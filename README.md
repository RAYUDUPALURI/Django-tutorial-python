# Django Overview

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it comes with a wide array of features that facilitate backend web development, such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), authentication mechanisms, and an admin interface.

## Key Features of Django:
- **MTV Architecture**: Django follows the Model-Template-View architectural pattern.
- **ORM**: Allows you to interact with databases using Python code instead of SQL.
- **Admin Interface**: Auto-generated, admin interface for your models.
- **Security**: Built-in protection against many security threats.

## Sample Code Snippets:

### Setting Up a New Django Project
```python
# Install Django via pip
pip install django

# Create a new Django project
django-admin startproject myproject

# Navigate into the project directory
cd myproject

# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver

Creating a New Application in Django
# Inside your project directory, create a new application
python manage.py startapp myapp

Defining a Model in Django
# In myapp/models.py
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()

Creating Views in Django
# In myapp/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MyModel

def index(request):
    items = MyModel.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'index.html', {'items': items})

Configuring URLs in Django
# In myproject/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from myapp import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]

Writing Templates in Django
<!-- In templates/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Django App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Items List</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for item in items %}
            <li>{{ item.title }}: {{ item.description }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
